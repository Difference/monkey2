Monkey2 TODO list.

This is list of stuff I consider reasonably urgent.

This doesn't include big picture things like new targets, modules etc.


* Mx2cc/builder/makedocs

	* Deal with Self.New/Super.New issues.

	* Deal with global/const order-of-initialization issues.

	* Wildcard/filtered asset importing so you can import a dir in one hit.

	* Add support for custom 'manuals' in module docs.

	* System assets folder support.


* Modules

	* Add lights/shadows to mojo.graphics.

	* Fix mojo.graphics 'font texture always 512x512' issue.

	* Better audio support - openalsoft?

	* Handle symlinks better in std.filesystem.
	
	* Network support - udp/tcp streams/servers and httprequest.

 
* Ted2

	* Draggable/closable tabs.

	* Filebrowser context menu.
	
	* Hotkeys for scripts.


* Misc

	* Add module upload/browser to monkey2.monkey-x.com.
	
	* Implement a libclang based 'API convertor' to help with wrapping 3rd party C/C++ libs.
