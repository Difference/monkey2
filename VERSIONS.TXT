***** Monkey2 v1.1.05 *****

* Added std.requesters.OpenUrl support for android and ios.

* Added WIP assimp and bullet modules mainly for future use by mojo3d but its nice to have standalone versions of these.

* Added tinyfiledialog library for linux requesters, except for Proceed which uses kdialog as there's no equivalent in tfd.

* Added WIP MSVC support for faster compile times on windows. To enable, use 'MX2_USE_MSVC=1' in bin/env_windows.txt and rebuild all modules.
