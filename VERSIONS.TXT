Added Edit->Goto line AT LAST!

Fixed TextView.CharRect bug returning bad width.

Restored Stream.ReadCString and Stream.WriteCString.

Made reflection optional. You now need to #Import "<reflection>" to activate it, and the first build of an app will be SLOW. Reflection is still 'all or nothing' for now.

Fixed some race conditions with Process objects going out of scope very quickly.
